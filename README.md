## This project is no longer hosted on GitHub!

# I was using GitHub Under Protest, but no longer so.

GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
especially after those Microsoft assholes bought it.
They will continue to [embrace, extend, extinguish](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=microsoft+embrace+extend+extinguish+github)
all they can get hold of.
Copilot, 2FA (preferably with their shitty own Authenticator!?), what's next?

I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host any kind of projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

Please don't fork this project back to GitHub.
