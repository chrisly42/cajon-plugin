Tries to convert most of the JUnit 4 assertions to AssertJ format.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<br>Works for assertTrue(), assertFalse(), assertNull(), assertNotNull(), assertEquals(), assertNotEquals(), assertSame() assertNotSame(), assertArrayEquals().
Copes with variants with message and without, handles special versions for double and float types (including arrays).
<p>
    Does not support Hamcrest-Matchers. If you need that kind of conversion, you might want to check out the Assertions2AssertJ plugin by Ric Emery.
