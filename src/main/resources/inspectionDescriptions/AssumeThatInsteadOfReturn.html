Tries to detect bogus uses of return statements in test methods and replaces them by assumeThat() calls.

Novices will use these to skip test execution by bailing out early on some preconditions not met.
However, this suggests that the test has actually been run and passed instead of showing the test
as being skipped.
<p>Return statements in if statements in main test methods
    (must be annotated with JUnit 4 or Jupiter @Test annotations)
    will be verified to have at least one assertThat() statement in the code flow.
    Method calls within the same class will be examined for assertThat() statements, too.
    However, at most 50 statements and down to five recursions will be tolerated before giving up.
</p>
<p>Currently, the quickfix may lose some comments during operation. The other branch of the if statement
    will be inlined (blocks with declarations will remain a code block due to variable scope).</p>
